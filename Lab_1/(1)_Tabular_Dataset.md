# Introduction

Tabular datasets are presented in a table-like format. These datasets are intuitive to interpret, with columns representing variables and rows representing samples. An example of tabular data is shown below:

| Sample | Variable 1 | Variable 2 | Variable 3 | Label |
|--------|------------|------------|------------|-------|
| 0      | 34         | 78         | 12         | 1     |
| 1      | 56         | 43         | 89         | 0     |
| 2      | 22         | 67         | 45         | 1     |
| 3      | 90         | 12         | 56         | 0     |
| 4      | 11         | 88         | 34         | 1     |
| 5      | 76         | 54         | 23         | 0     |
| 6      | 38         | 21         | 74         | 1     |
| 7      | 59         | 33         | 62         | 0     |
| 8      | 84         | 47         | 19         | 1     |
| 9     | 41         | 72         | 53         | 0     |

In this example, there are 5 columns in total. Three columns represent different variables, one column identifies the sample name, and one column contains the labels. We can also see that this dataset consists of 10 samples in total.

In the following example, we will work with a commonly used dataset: the breast cancer dataset. This dataset is widely recognised in the machine learning field, where the goal is to predict the presence of cancer based on features extracted from an image.
