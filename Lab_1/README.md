# Introduction
In this lab, we will practice exploratory data analysis (EDA) on three different datasets. These will be (1) tabular, (2) spectroscopy and (3) image datasets. Click on the directory and follow the instructions, starting off with the tabular dataset.
You will also find the corresponding datasets within the Lab_1 directory, which you will need to download and then upload to your Google Colab session. 

# Learning Outcomes
- Apply EDA to tabular, spectroscopy and image datasets
- Compare text vs graphical representation of your data
- Debug where needed
